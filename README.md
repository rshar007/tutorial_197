# Research on Discontinuous constituent structures

## Summary of the tutorial
Working closely  with Professor Emeritus Edward  Keenan, this tutorial
hopes   to  review   literature  on   the  problem   of  discontinuous
constituents  in  nuclear  clauses.    Building  on  the  examples  of
discontinuous constituents  as outlined in  his Course Reader  for his
class  on  Mathematical  structures  in Language,  I  will  meet  with
Professor Keenan  on a  weekly basis to  review current  literature by
linguists on how to  reconcile discontinuous constituents with current
theory.   I  will  incorporate  a  formal  approach  to  the  subject,
completing a paper for this tutorial as proof of my work.

## Outline of the proposed course of study
Week 3 - Reading and review of early work on DC
Week 4 - Reading and review of modern work on DC
Week 5 - Formalization of problem
Week 6 - Organization of paper
Week 7 - Draft of paper
Week 8 - Review of draft
Week 9 - Final paper preparation
Week 10 - Completion of paper

## Tangible evidence
As described above, I will complete a paper as proof of my work during
this tutorial. Furthermore, I will provide literature review summaries
and  a  mathematical formalization  to  the  problem of  discontinuous
constituents  in nuclear  sentences  by week  5.  Furthermore, I  will
prepare two drafts before submitting my final paper in week 10.
